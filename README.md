About the mod
-------------

This is a fork of [Hot or Not](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/hot-or-not) by [Buuz135](https://www.curseforge.com/members/buuz135) and [Affehund](https://www.curseforge.com/members/affehund) with enhanced functionality and optional support for [TerraFirmaCraft](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/terrafirmacraft) and [Tinker's Forging](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tinkers-forging) for Minecraft 1.12.2.

Burn players if they carry hot fluids or items and slow players if they carry cold fluids, highly configurable. It adapts to the temperature system of TerraFirmaCraft and Tinker's Forging concerning items (ingots etc.) and should work with any fluid containers that are properly coded.

Wear your protection!
